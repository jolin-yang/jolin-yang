##  👋 Hi there, I'm Jolin!
**🎓 Rising sophomore @ Northeastern University, studying Computer Science with a concentration in AI   
👩🏻‍💻 Aspiring Software Engineer  
🌐 Tech and data enthusiast** 

I enjoy working with data and applying Machine Learning to develop impactful solutions that address real-world problems. My main goal is to leverage technology to make a difference in people's lives, with a focus on tackling algorithmic biases. I'm passionate about making today's tech space more inclusive and challenging the stereotypes that surround this industry. 

I'm currently strengthening my foundation in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence through Break Through Tech's AI program, hosted at MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, where I've gained hands-on experience training and building machine learning models using real-world datasets. With AI's ever-growing impact on society, I'm excited to explore the processes that shape AI and delve into the different ways it can be used for social good.  

I'm eager to apply my skills to research or internship settings, where I'll be able to develop my technical skills, contribute to meaningful projects, and learn from seasoned professionals in the tech industry!

**Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Github, Git   

## 🚀 Projects
Some (personal and school-related) projects I've worked on: 
1. **Minesweeper Game**  
   Designed a Minesweeper-inspired game, employing object-oriented programming principles and human-centered interaction design.  
   **Tech Stack**: Java, Eclipse  
   **Result**: Implemented a fully functional game that included all aspects of the original Minesweeper game with some additional enhancements:
   - Flagging: Players can right-click on the cells they suspect to be mines to flag them
   - Neighboring cell count: When the player clicks on a non-mine cell, it reveals the number of mines neighboring it
   - Floodfill effect: When the player clicks on a non-mine cell with zero neighboring mines, the game recursively reveals all adjacent non-mine cells in a cascading flood-fill-like manner, uncovering an entire region of connected non-mine cells until it reaches a cell with a non-zero neighboring mine count.
   - Restart: Players can click on the return key after winning/losing to restart the game with a new layout of mines
  **Learnings**: Game development, game design

2. **Wordle Game**  
   Designed a Wordle-inspired game with a unique spin and some added enhancements.  
   **Tech Stack**: Java  
   **Result**: Implemented a fully functional game that included key aspects of the original Wordle game with some additional enhancements:
   - Target bank: Takes user input for size of the target bank + generates target bank of that size out of a 2500+ word pool
   - Score calculator: Outputs a 5-digit score of the user’s input based on the closeness of the letters to the target word 
   - Word validator: Validates user’s guess is an actual 5-letter word from target bank; if not, prompts user to guess again
   - Best guess solver: outputs best guess for target word based on min average # of guesses and min duplicate scores to words in target bank
   **Learnings**: Game development
